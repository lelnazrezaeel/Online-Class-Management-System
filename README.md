# Online-Class-Management-System
The Online Class Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate various aspects of online classes. It caters to three types of users: Professors, Students, and Educational Assistants. Professors and Educational Assistants can create and manage classes, track attendance, and more. Students can participate in classes and submit assignments. Additionally, there are system support personnel responsible for system maintenance and user management.

The project is divided into four phases, each serving a specific purpose:

### Phase 1: Domain Description

In this initial phase, we provided a thorough description of the project's domain. We outlined the subject matter and identified key aspects of the system's functionality. A sample domain description was made available as a reference.

### Phase 2: Database Design (ER Diagram)

Building upon the domain description from Phase 1, we proceeded to design the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the underlying database. To ensure consistency and accuracy, we utilized Max EDraw software for ER diagram creation.

### Phase 3: Database Schema

With the ER diagram established in Phase 2, we moved on to define the database schema. This involved specifying tables, their columns, relationships, and other pertinent details. Additionally, we included ERD graphs, reference graphs, table columns, and more. This phase laid the foundation for our database implementation.

### Phase 4: Database Implementation

The fourth and final phase involved the practical implementation of our database, adhering to the schema defined in Phase 3. SQL (Structured Query Language) and SQL Server were employed for this purpose. The SQL commands implemented in this phase encompassed various aspects:

- **Table Creation**: We created tables as required by the project.
- **Data Retrieval (Queries)**: We crafted a range of SQL queries, including both simple and complex queries. At least 20 queries were implemented to support the system's functionality.
- **Data Insertion**: To test the accuracy of our queries, we inserted sample data into the tables.
- **Schema Modifications**: We demonstrated the ability to modify tables, such as adding new columns.
- **Row Manipulation**: This included altering rows within tables (e.g., changing user information) and deleting rows when necessary.
- **Constraint Management**: We added, updated, and deleted constraints within the database schema, ensuring data integrity.
- **Additional Elements**: We implemented triggers, views, procedures, and functions, with at least two instances of each.

It's worth noting that some of the queries outlined in Phase 1 were brought to life in this phase, following consultation and coordination with our mentor.

## Folder Structure

Our project repository is organized into four folders, each corresponding to one of the project phases:

- **Phase 1**: This folder contains detailed domain descriptions and sample queries.
- **Phase 2**: It includes the ER diagram created using Max EDraw.
- **Phase 3**: Within this folder, you'll find comprehensive schema information, along with diagrams.
- **Phase 4**: This section encompasses the SQL implementation of the database, comprising tables, queries, constraints, and additional elements.

To delve deeper into each phase, refer to the PDF files provided within the respective folders.
